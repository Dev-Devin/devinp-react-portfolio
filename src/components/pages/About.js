          <p className="about">
            I have 8+ years of professional experience in a variety of
            operational roles in New York. Most recently, I served as Chief of
            Staff to the COO at a healthcare tech startup where I spent a lot of
            time collaborating with engineers and developers, ultimately
            inspiring me to make a pivot. Leveraging my background in
            operations, I am able to take usersâ€™ needs and issues, translate to
            product solutions, and execute the technical work.
